# captchasolverexamples
Examples for solving captchas via services like Anti-Captcha, CapSolver and 2Captcha.
There are some trouble points:
1. Anti-Captcha requires a hefty price per 1000 solutions (like 3000 or more), or you will be in the queue forever.
2. 2Captcha does not working properly (even with turnstile example).
